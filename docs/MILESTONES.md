# GroundLab milestones

## Milestone 0 — Project seed

Implemented.

- Rust workspace
- Pure core crate with no UI dependencies
- Workbench shell crate
- CLI export crate
- Default dry upland art recipe

## Milestone 1 — Live pixel terrain asset lab

Implemented.

- deterministic tile generation from `TilesetRecipe`
- fixed palette ramps
- terrain materials: grass, dirt, mud, rock, trench floor, trench wall, berm top, berm face
- tile variants
- contact sheet and atlas export
- editable terrain grid preview
- brushes: paint, trench, berm, ditch, flatten
- overlays: material, height, slope, movement, route, line of sight
- custom A* route preview
- custom grid-based LOS query

## Milestone 1.1 — Erected terrain preview

Implemented.

- first software-rendered 2.5D pass
- top surfaces displaced upward by height
- exposed faces between height deltas
- workbench face fading for inspectability
- approximate hit testing in erected view

## Milestone 2 — Better asset pipeline

Implemented.

- external RON recipe loading/saving
- external RON palette loading/saving
- auto-reload polling for recipe/palette edits
- material transition tiles
- generated height masks
- generated normal maps
- generated shadow masks
- generated occlusion masks
- seam-test sheet
- validation report
- metadata-rich export bundle
- CLI `export` and `validate` commands

## Milestone 3 — Terrain extrusion and occlusion workbench

Implemented in this drop.

- generated structure-face tiles: front, left, right, and lip
- structure-face metadata in `TileMetadata`
- structure face masks for height, normal, shadow, and occlusion outputs
- validation count coverage for structure faces
- seam-test/contact-sheet display of structure faces
- 2.5D terrain preview uses generated face art instead of flat debug rectangles
- terrain lips/cut-edges are rendered using generated lip art
- projected route overlay draws in erected terrain mode
- hover-driven local cutaway lens fades occluding faces near the inspected cell
- global face fade remains as a workbench-only debug option
- CLI/app export target defaults to `exports/milestone_03`

Milestone 3 is deliberately still CPU/software-preview based. It makes the asset/rendering contract
stronger before `wgpu` runtime work begins.

## Milestone 3.1 — Slope/ramp and corner structure pass

Recommended if visual readability still feels too blocky.

- diagonal/corner face pieces
- ramp/slope top tiles
- trench corner lips
- berm corner lips
- face seam validation by face kind
- hidden-object x-ray silhouettes in the software preview

## Milestone 4 — Custom renderer/runtime

- introduce `ground_render`
- `wgpu` native renderer
- sprite batching
- tilemap layer renderer
- nearest-neighbor sampling / pixel-perfect camera
- y + elevation sorting
- debug overlay render passes
- keep `eframe` either as editor shell or replace it with raw `winit + wgpu + egui`

## Milestone 5 — Terrain gameplay sandbox

- fixed-step simulation
- enemy agents
- route preview vs actual movement
- cover queries
- defender positions
- selected-defense LOS overlay
- objective and spawn definitions

## Milestone 6 — Rolling hazard sandbox

- custom rolling-log model based on height gradient
- controllable release triggers
- collision against enemies/obstacles at grid/sprite level
- path trace overlay
- impact/damage summary

## Milestone 7 — Prepared-ground vertical slice

- prep phase
- assault phase
- budget/labor model
- post-run explanation
- one polished dry upland outpost map
